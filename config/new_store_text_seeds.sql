All players must be 21 or older.&nbsp; Teams are permitted to play with less than three (3) players to avoid a complete forfeit and add to the team&rsquo;s total points for the season.</p>\r\n<p>Substitute players &ndash; Team&rsquo;s may utilize substitute players if a team member is unable to play. SUBSTITUTE PLAYERS MAY NOT BE ON ANY OTHER SKEEBALL TEAM OR HAVE SUBSTITUTED ON ANY OTHER SKEEBALL TEAM DURING THE CURRENT SEASON. Teams in violation will be given a complete forfeit for the game resulting in zero (0) total points.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Game Play:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>A match will consist of two (2) teams, (all six (6) players) rolling ten (10) frames.</p>\r\n<p>Competing teams will roll on the same lane the entire match.</p>\r\n<p>Every ball must be rolled while standing with both feet located behind the machines.</p>\r\n<p>Balls that fail to enter the scoring zone and roll or otherwise return to the thrower are able to be re-thrown.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Skeeball scores presented on the machines screen will be divided by 1000 (the last three zeros dropped) to simplify scoring.</p>\r\n<p>Each frame will count as its own game resulting in a \"win\" or \"loss\". Example 1: \"Team A\" rolls 280, 210, 360 in frame 1 totaling 850. \"Team B\" rolls 300, 360, 410 in frame 1 totaling 1070. \"Team B\" would be credited with a \"win\" for frame 1. All 10 frames will be scored the same way. Example 2: \"Team A\" wins 6 of the 10 frames, \"Team B\" would therefore have lost 6 of the 10 frames. The record for these two teams would be recorded as: \"Team A\" 6-4, \"Team B\" 4-6. The season end record will be the total wins and losses of the combined 90 frames rolled. Example: 75-15 (75 wins - 15 losses)</p>\r\n<p>All teams must roll regardless of whether or not their opponents show up in order to get wins for the match.&nbsp; Total points can also be an important factor in determining which teams qualify for the tournament.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Ghost Teams:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Locations that registered an odd number of teams will need to &ldquo;play&rdquo; an invisible Ghost Team. To win a frame against a Ghost Team, your team will need to score better than 660 (the current predefined score for Ghost Teams) for that frame.</p>\r\n<p>All teams must roll regardless if their opponent forfeits or the team is playing the Ghost Team 660. We need the total score for the end of season tournament ranking system. If the team does not roll, they will not receive the win.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Season Ending Playoff Tournament:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Top teams will compete for the overall Skeeball World Tour Champion at the season ending playoff tournament at the Bedford Winking Lizard Party Center in Bedford, Ohio at the conclusion of each season.</p>\r\n<p>Automatic Bids &ndash; Each location will be given a certain number of automatic bids (top 2-4 teams determined by overall record) based on number of teams at that location.</p>\r\n<p>Wild Card Teams &ndash; Wild Card teams (based on total skeeball teams) will be given to non-automatic bid teams determined by total points.</p>\r\n<p>Prizes will be awarded to the top team from each location as well as the top two (2) teams from the season ending playoff tournament.</p>\r\n<p>A second chance mini tournament will be available to all teams that lost in the first round.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Sportsmanship:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>Skeeball is intended to be a fun and entertaining competition.

It\'ll be held at it\'s usual location (the Winking Lizard Party Center in Bedford Heights). There will be plenty of great prizes. Everyone in attendance is eligible to win... whether or not you qualify to play the tournament... but you do have to be present to win. The Second Chance Bracket remains for teams eliminated from the first round.</p>\r\n<p>Now onto the changes. We\'re reducing the number of tournament teams from 54 to 32. This will not only make the tournament an hour and a half shorter, but it will also reduce the number of no-shows (forfeited matches) greatly. In addition to reducing the total number of tournament teams, changes have been made to the criteria involved in qualifying. The number of automatic qualifiers per store has been reduced, placing somewhat more emphasis on points and somewhat less emphasis on record. Needing to do this became obvious once we reduced the number of teams to 32. The end result is a more competitive tournament, while still ensuring that each store has adequate representation regardless of their point totals.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"/qualifiers\">Current Tournament Qualifiers</a></strong> (and their ranking order) are available for viewing.
